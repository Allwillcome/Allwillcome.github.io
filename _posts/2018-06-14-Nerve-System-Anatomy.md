description: 神经系统解剖视频

神经系统在人体各个器官系统中居于主导地位，它控制和协调各个器官系统的活动，使人体成为一个有机整体。
 但神经系统分布于颅腔、脊椎以及身体其它隐秘部位，不便于像肌肉、骨骼那样能够触摸，进行直观的认识。借助标本解剖（Gross Specimen）视频可以对神经系统各个结构的形状、大小和结构之间的位置关系有形象直观的认识。相比较用电脑辅助设计，用不同颜色和形状对神经系统构图的解剖图谱和动画的解剖视频，标本解剖更加直观，贴近实际。如通过临床解剖视频你可以了解到端脑并非是坚硬的半球而是像果冻般，容易改变形状；硬脑膜并非坚硬无比，而是如书上所言“坚韧”，就像泳帽般。

 笔者无意中在犹他大学的图书馆网站上发现了关于神经系统的解剖视频，个人看后对神经系统有了更加形象直观的了解，现在分享给大家，希望对大家有用。**点击下面超链接进行跳转。**

*About the Neuroanatomy Video Lab: Brain Dissections
This series of Neuroanatomy video lessons with brain dissections has two principal objectives. The first is to provide viewers access to human brain specimens, something lacking in many places. The second is to simplify the anatomy, omitting some details, and making numerous generalizations. This helps keep the focus on the localization of a patient's disease within the nervous system. Students are often overwhelmed with excessive detail which makes the correlation of structure and function more difficult. The presentation sequence is in a logical order for a class, but each video is designed to standalone and be used just-in-time to make a clinical point.

*More About the Neuroanatomy Video Lab: Brain Dissections
The series originated when teaching with a neurologist in Ghana and Kenya where it was clear when anatomy was taught and separated from the clinic by many years, much was not retained. Here Dr. Stensaas presents just enough anatomy to localize the patient's problem. These videos can be used before or after a clinical case presentation. Apologies are offered for a few minor errors that could not be corrected due to the one time recording opportunity as well as an unscripted personal style.*

①观看此系列课程，可能需要 ke xue shang wang；
②本课程配有英文字幕，但无中文字幕。视频中有许多专有名词，如temporal（颞骨的）、cortex（皮质）、dura（硬脑膜）等，但除专业术语外无太多生僻词。
③对于运动人体科学相关专业学生学习本视频内容可以参考罗冬梅老师主编的《运动解剖学》
